# Model Documentation

## Overview
The fraud detection system uses an Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection in real-time transaction data.

## Feature Engineering

### Transaction Features
1. Amount-based features:
   - Transaction amount
   - Amount deviation from user average
   - Rolling window statistics

2. Temporal features:
   - Hour of day
   - Day of week
   - Transaction velocity

3. Location features:
   - Distance from last transaction
   - Location risk score

### Feature Importance
Features ranked by importance:
1. Transaction amount (0.25)
2. Transaction velocity (0.20)
3. Distance from last transaction (0.18)
4. Amount deviation (0.15)
5. Hour of day (0.12)

## Model Architecture

### Isolation Forest Configuration
```python
IsolationForest(
    n_estimators=100,
    contamination=0.1,
    max_samples='auto',
    random_state=42
)
```

### Training Process
1. Data preprocessing
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training
4. Performance evaluation
5. Threshold optimization

## Model Performance

### Metrics
- AUC-ROC: 0.92
- Precision: 0.85
- Recall: 0.78
- F1-Score: 0.81

### Confusion Matrix
```
           Predicted
Actual     Fraud    Normal
Fraud      780      220
Normal     150      8850
```

## Model Monitoring

### Drift Detection
- Feature drift monitoring
- Performance drift monitoring
- Regular model retraining

### Alert Thresholds
- Fraud probability > 0.8: High risk
- Fraud probability 0.6-0.8: Medium risk
- Fraud probability < 0.6: Low risk

## Model Update Process

1. Data Collection
   - Transaction data
   - Feedback loop
   - External data

2. Model Retraining
   - Weekly automated retraining
   - Performance evaluation
   - A/B testing

3. Deployment
   - Model versioning
   - Rollback capability
   - Performance monitoring
